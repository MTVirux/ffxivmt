# RECOMMENDED CRONS TO SET:

# TODO:
- Create API documentation
- Create API key system
- Create a container to manage crons(?)
- Make API endpoints instead of the various controllers
- Make function to recreate preaproved items based on rules and store them in DB instead of config
- Separate frontend to another repo
- Ponder fusing nuke_all script with clear_docker_cache script (bat and sh)
- Move this to do list to github issues
- Figure out what's Dependabot
- What is even going on with Item_model -> get_by_name() ??????????
- Give loading divs a fancy gif for UX improvement
- Verify ITEM_SCORE logs as always present "# of keus: 1"

# BY THE 12 PLEASE REMEMBER TO MOVE THESE TO ISSUES
